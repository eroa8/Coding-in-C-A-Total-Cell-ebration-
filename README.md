Coding in C: A Total Cell-ebration! UIC College of Engineering
\nThis project implements a 1-dimensional totalistic cellular automaton in C, using a modular and structured approach. Each cell evolves based on the sum of its own state and its immediate neighbors, with rules defined by an integer (0–2186), converted to base-3 to determine behavior across 7 possible sums (0–6).
